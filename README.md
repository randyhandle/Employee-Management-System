# Employee-Management-System
My first full stack project using Springboot, ReactJS


First we need to create a database called "ems"
and a table named "employee" with 'id','firstName','lastName','email'

Then open the project in intellij and use "./mvnw spring-boot:run" command to run or simply click the run button
And then open the "ems-frontend" file in VScode, use "npm run dev" command to run the react application

Now, you can type for "http://localhost:3000/" in browser to use the application
